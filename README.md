Our driver assistance system consists of an electronic hub consisting of multiple sensors fetching raw data of parameters such as acceleration , speed, distance , brake detection ,
vibration and relative distance b/w vehicles on the road .
The driver assistance system at fixed intervals of time, transfers the vehicleâ€™s
above-mentioned parameters to a remote server (using Thingspeak). After processing the
parameters, the remote server alerts the user when a principle is being violated on an application
and makes the suggestions mentioned above in the form of an app.
